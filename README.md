# 🔌 UKOapp – Realtime Communication Microservice  

This microservice provides **realtime, bidirectional communication** between the UKOapp frontend and backend using **WebSockets**. It powers live updates, instant notifications, and collaborative features across the platform.  

---

## 🚀 Overview  

- Uses **Socket.IO** (built on WebSockets) for efficient, low-latency communication.  
- Handles **realtime user interactions** such as chat, notifications, live reactions, and sync events.  
- Designed as a **scalable microservice**, deployable independently of the main API.  
- Lightweight and optimized to handle **high concurrency**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express  
- **Sockets**: Socket.IO (WebSockets fallback)  
- **Database**: Redis (pub/sub for distributed socket events)  
- **Containerization**: Docker for isolated deployment  
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx or HAProxy for scaling multiple socket instances
